# Codewars Katas

Coding is fun and is meant to always be fun. This repo is a place to hold katas that I've done to keep that spirit up. This will primarily by in Rust as I want to work on my Rust proficiency, but perhaps in the future I might start including solutions in other languages in this repo.

# Maintenance

Since this is mainly a place to store solutions to katas, I don't think I plan on revisiting old solutions often.
